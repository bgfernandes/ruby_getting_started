# Ruby: Getting Started

Following the Getting Started guide on Rails website: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

Some conclusions I got from this small guide:

Rails is not for begginers. You can't dive into a framework as complex and full of "magic" as it is without a good grasp of how RESTful web apps work, as well as de MVC pattern, not to mention a good understanding of the Ruby language. I read this somewhere, and it strikes me as true:

"Frameworks make it easier for experienced developers to build meaningful projects quickly, which they are then able to maintain based on their deeper technical understanding. Frameworks may help inexperienced people play with a simple web app. But frameworks don't let the average person build and maintain complex web apps."

Rails helps to build simple web apps incredibly fast, but for anything slightly more complex than the example here, one has to look under the hood, and dwelve deeper into the rails documentation.

This excellent article about Abstractions from Trello Cofounder and Stack Overflow CEO Joel Spolsky is from 2002, but it is so relevant to this date that it should become part of computer science mandatory reading:

Personally, Rails does not strike my fancy, I like to get "down and dirty" on my applications. I will give frameworks another shot though, I read good things about Django.

But I will give Ruby another shot, maybe for a next project I`ll look into Sinatra.
